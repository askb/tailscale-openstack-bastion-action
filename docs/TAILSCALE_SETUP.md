# Tailscale Setup Guide

Complete guide for configuring Tailscale for Packer builds with bastion hosts.

## Overview

This action requires Tailscale for secure connectivity between GitHub Actions runners and OpenStack bastion hosts. This guide covers both OAuth (recommended) and auth key methods.

## Prerequisites

- Tailscale account (free tier works)
- Admin access to Tailscale organization
- GitHub repository with appropriate permissions

## Authentication Methods

### OAuth Client (Recommended)

OAuth clients provide:

- ✅ Better security with scoped permissions
- ✅ Automatic token rotation
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ No manual key rotation

### Auth Keys (Legacy)

Auth keys are simpler but:

- ⚠️ Require manual rotation
- ⚠️ Less granular permissions
- ⚠️ Deprecated by Tailscale

---

## Method 1: OAuth Client Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create OAuth Client

1. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console → OAuth Clients](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/oauth)
2. Click **"Generate OAuth client"**
3. Configure settings:
   - **Description:** `GitHub Actions - Packer Builds`
   - **Write Scopes:** Select `auth_keys`
   - **Tags:** `tag:ci`, `tag:bastion`
4. Click **"Generate client"**
5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy both values immediately:
   - **Client ID:** `kA4v...` → Save as `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - **Client Secret:** `tskey-client-kA4v...` → Save as `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_SECRET`

### Step 2: Configure ACLs

Update your Tailscale ACL at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls

```json
{
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:ci": ["autogroup:admin", "autogroup:owner", "tag:ci"],
    "tag:bastion": [
      "autogroup:admin",
      "autogroup:owner",
      "tag:ci",
      "tag:bastion"
    ]
  },

  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["autogroup:admin", "tag:ci", "tag:bastion"],
      "dst": ["*:*"]
    }
  ],

  "grants": [
    {
      "src": ["*"],
      "dst": ["*"],
      "ip": ["*"]
    }
  ],

  "ssh": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["autogroup:member", "tag:ci"],
      "dst": ["tag:bastion"],
      "users": ["root", "ubuntu", "autogroup:nonroot"]
    }
  ],

  "autoApprovers": {
    "routes": {
      "0.0.0.0/0": ["autogroup:admin"],
      "::/0": ["autogroup:admin"]
    },
    "exitNode": ["autogroup:admin"]
  }
}
```

**Key ACL Settings:**

- **tagOwners:** Defines who can create devices with specific tags. Tags can own themselves for OAuth workflows (`tag:ci` owns `tag:ci`, `tag:bastion` owns `tag:bastion`)
- **acls:** Network access rules between tags
- **ssh:** Tailscale SSH permissions (required for bastion access)
- **grants:** IP-level access control (optional, can be more restrictive)

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Add these secrets:

| Secret Name                 | Value                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | `kA4v...` (Client ID)       |
| `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_SECRET`    | `tskey-client-...` (Secret) |

### Step 4: Use in Workflow

```yaml
- uses: lfit/releng-packer-action@main
  with:
    mode: build
    tailscale_oauth_client_id: ${{ secrets.TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID }}
    tailscale_oauth_secret: ${{ secrets.TAILSCALE_OAUTH_SECRET }}
    tailscale_tags: "tag:ci,tag:bastion"
    # ... other parameters
```

---

## Method 2: Auth Key Setup (Legacy)

### Step 1: Generate Auth Key

1. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console → Settings → Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
2. Click **"Generate auth key"**
3. Configure settings:
   - **Description:** `GitHub Actions - Bastion Hosts`
   - ✅ **Ephemeral** - Devices auto-remove when disconnected
   - ✅ **Reusable** - Use for multiple workflow runs
   - ✅ **Pre-authorized** - Skip manual approval
   - **Tags:** `tag:bastion`
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or as needed)
4. Click **"Generate key"**
5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the key immediately:
   - Starts with `tskey-auth-...`
   - Save as `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY`
   - You won't be able to see it again!

### Step 2: Configure ACLs

Use the same ACL configuration as OAuth method above.

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secret

Go to **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Add secret:

| Secret Name          | Value            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` | `tskey-auth-...` |

### Step 4: Use in Workflow

```yaml
- uses: lfit/releng-packer-action@main
  with:
    mode: build
    tailscale_auth_key: ${{ secrets.TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY }}
    # ... other parameters
```

## ACL Configuration Details

### Understanding tagOwners

Tags must be owned to be assigned. The `tagOwners` section defines who can tag devices:

```json
"tagOwners": {
  "tag:ci": ["autogroup:admin", "autogroup:owner", "tag:ci"],
  "tag:bastion": ["autogroup:admin", "autogroup:owner", "tag:ci", "tag:bastion"]
}
```

- **autogroup:admin** - Tailscale admins
- **autogroup:owner** - Organization owners
- **tag:ci** - Devices/clients with `tag:ci` can tag other devices with `tag:bastion`, and can self-own (required for OAuth)
- **tag:bastion** - Can self-own (required for OAuth workflows)

### Understanding ACLs

Network access control between sources and destinations:

```json
"acls": [
  {
    "action": "accept",
    "src": ["autogroup:admin", "tag:ci", "tag:bastion"],
    "dst": ["*:*"]
  }
]
```

- **src:** Who can initiate connections (admin users, CI runners, bastions)
- **dst:** What they can connect to (`*:*` = everything)
- **action:** `accept` allows, `deny` blocks

### Understanding SSH Rules

Tailscale SSH replaces traditional SSH key management:

```json
"ssh": [
  {
    "action": "accept",
    "src": ["autogroup:member", "tag:ci"],
    "dst": ["tag:bastion"],
    "users": ["root", "ubuntu", "autogroup:nonroot"]
  }
]
```

- **src:** Who can SSH (org members, CI runners)
- **dst:** Where they can SSH (bastion hosts)
- **users:** Which users they can SSH as

## Verification

### Verify OAuth Client

1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/oauth
2. Find your client: "GitHub Actions - Packer Builds"
3. Check:
   - ✅ Status: Active
   - ✅ Scopes: `auth_keys`
   - ✅ Tags: `tag:ci`, `tag:bastion`

### Verify ACLs

1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls
2. Click **"Validate"** button
3. Should show: ✅ "ACL is valid"
4. No errors about missing tags or invalid syntax

### Test Workflow

1. Run workflow manually
2. Check **"Setup Tailscale VPN"** step logs
3. Should see:
   ```
   ✅ Connected to Tailscale network
   ```
4. Verify devices appear at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines

## Troubleshooting

This section documents common Tailscale failures encountered during development and their solutions, organized by authentication method.

### OAuth Client Failures

#### Error: "Status: 403, Message: calling actor does not have enough permissions"

**Symptoms:**

```
timeout 5m sudo -E tailscale up ${TAGS_ARG} --authkey=${TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY}
Status: 403, Message: "calling actor does not have enough permissions to perform this function"
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root Cause:** OAuth client missing required write scope for `auth_keys`

**Solution:**

1. Delete existing OAuth client
2. Create new OAuth client with:
   - **Write Scopes:** `auth_keys` (not just read)
   - **Tags:** `tag:ci`, `tag:bastion`
3. Update GitHub secret `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_SECRET` with new client secret
4. Verify in OAuth settings that `auth_keys` has write permission

**Prevention:** Always select write scopes, not just read-only scopes

---

#### Error: "requested tags [tag:bastion] are invalid or not permitted"

**Symptoms:**

```
backend error: requested tags [tag:bastion] are invalid or not permitted
2025-10-10 12:02:17,965 - cc_scripts_user.py[WARNING]: Failed to run module scripts_user
```

**Root Cause:** Tags not properly configured in ACL `tagOwners` or OAuth client

**Solution:**

1. Verify ACL configuration includes self-ownership:
   ```json
   "tagOwners": {
     "tag:ci": ["autogroup:admin", "autogroup:owner", "tag:ci"],
     "tag:bastion": ["autogroup:admin", "autogroup:owner", "tag:ci", "tag:bastion"]
   }
   ```
2. Check OAuth client has both tags configured in Tailscale admin console
3. Validate ACL syntax in Tailscale admin console
4. Ensure tags can self-own (`tag:ci` in tagOwners for `tag:ci`)

**Prevention:** Always test ACL changes with "Validate" button before saving

---

#### Error: "An action could not be found at URI" (Setup Failure)

**Symptoms:**

```
##[error]An action could not be found at the URI
'https://api.github.com/repos/tailscale/github-action/tarball/9b0941a...'
```

**Root Cause:** Invalid GitHub Action commit SHA or tag

**Solution:**

1. Verify commit SHA exists in repository:
   ```bash
   git ls-remote https://github.com/tailscale/github-action.git
   ```
2. Use valid commit SHA: `6cae46e2d796f265265cfcf628b72a32b4d7cade` (v3.3.0)
3. Update workflow to use correct reference
4. Consider using tagged release instead of SHA

**Prevention:** Use stable version tags (`v3`) instead of specific commits

---

### Auth Key Failures

#### Error: "tailnet policy does not permit you to SSH to this node"

**Symptoms:**

```
Checking bastion logs:
tailscale: tailnet policy does not permit you to SSH to this node
Connection closed by 100.114.132.117 port 22
```

**Root Cause:** Missing or incorrect SSH rules in Tailscale ACL

**Solution:**

1. Add SSH rules to ACL:
   ```json
   "ssh": [
     {
       "action": "accept",
       "src": ["autogroup:member", "tag:ci"],
       "dst": ["tag:bastion"],
       "users": ["root", "ubuntu", "autogroup:nonroot"]
     }
   ]
   ```
2. Ensure source (`src`) includes `tag:ci` for GitHub runners
3. Ensure destination (`dst`) includes `tag:bastion` for bastion hosts
4. Validate ACL and save changes
5. Wait 30 seconds for ACL propagation

**Prevention:** Include SSH rules when initially configuring ACLs

---

#### Error: "ACL validation failed: only tag:name, group:name, ... are allowed"

**Symptoms:**

```
Error: tagOwners["tag:ci"]: "client:klxjxddgd511cntrl":
only tag:name, group:name, role autogroups, or user@domain are allowed
```

**Root Cause:** Attempting to add OAuth client ID directly to `tagOwners`

**Solution:**

1. Remove client IDs from `tagOwners`
2. Use only valid owner types:
   - `autogroup:admin`
   - `autogroup:owner`
   - `tag:ci` (for self-ownership)
   - User emails (`user@domain.com`)
3. OAuth clients inherit permissions via tags, not direct ownership
4. Validate ACL syntax

**Prevention:** OAuth clients don't appear in `tagOwners` - use tag self-ownership instead

---

### Network & Connectivity Failures

#### Error: Bastion Ready Marker Not Found

**Symptoms:**

```
Waiting for bastion ready marker... (attempt 24/24)
⚠️ Bastion reachable but ready marker not found, proceeding anyway...
```

**Root Cause:**

- Cloud-init failed to complete
- Tailscale failed to start on bastion
- `/tmp/bastion-ready` marker file not created

**Solution:**

1. Check cloud-init logs on bastion:
   ```bash
   openstack console log show bastion-gh-<run-id> | tail -100
   ```
2. Look for Tailscale startup errors
3. Verify bastion instance has outbound internet access
4. Check OpenStack network security groups allow HTTPS (443)
5. Increase `BASTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT` if bastion is slow to boot

**Common Cloud-Init Failures:**

- Network not ready before Tailscale setup
- Missing dependencies (curl, ca-certificates)
- Tailscale package download timeout
- OAuth/auth key credential errors

**Prevention:**

- Use cloud-init with proper dependency ordering
- Add retry logic for network-dependent operations
- Set reasonable timeouts (5+ minutes)

---

#### Error: Bastion Tailscale IP Not Returned

**Symptoms:**

```
=== Bastion Status ===
Hostname: bastion-gh-18406355108
Tailscale IP:
======================
```

**Root Cause:**

- Bastion joined Tailscale but IP not propagated yet
- ACL rules preventing IP assignment
- Tailscale daemon not fully started

**Solution:**

1. Wait 30-60 seconds for IP assignment
2. Check ACL grants allow IP assignment:
   ```json
   "grants": [
     {
       "src": ["*"],
       "dst": ["*"],
       "ip": ["*"]
     }
   ]
   ```
3. Verify bastion in Tailscale admin console shows IP
4. Add retry logic to wait for IP assignment
5. Check `tailscale status` on bastion shows IP address

**Prevention:** Add sleep/retry after bastion joins network

---

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to diagnose Tailscale issues:

**In Workflow:**

```yaml
env:
  TS_DEBUG: "1"
```

**Debug Output Shows:**

- Detailed connection attempts
- ACL policy evaluation
- SSH authentication flow
- Network route propagation

**To Enable in Action:**
Add environment variable before Tailscale setup:

```bash
export TS_DEBUG=1
```

---

### Getting Help

If issues persist after following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Workflow Logs:**

   - Download logs from GitHub Actions
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Note timing of failures (setup vs. runtime)

2. **Check Bastion Console Logs:**

   ```bash
   openstack console log show bastion-gh-<run-id> > bastion.log
   ```

3. **Verify Tailscale Admin Console:**

   - Check if devices appear in machine list
   - Review ACL test results
   - Check OAuth client activity logs

4. **Test Locally:**

   - Try connecting with same credentials locally
   - Verify OAuth client works outside GitHub Actions
   - Test SSH rules manually

5. **Open an Issue:**
   - Include workflow logs
   - Include bastion console logs
   - Specify authentication method (OAuth vs auth key)
   - Share ACL configuration (redact sensitive info)

## Security Best Practices

### OAuth Secrets

- ✅ Store in GitHub encrypted secrets
- ✅ Never commit to repository
- ✅ Rotate every 90 days
- ✅ Use separate OAuth clients for prod/dev

### Auth Keys

- ✅ Use ephemeral keys (auto-cleanup)
- ✅ Set expiration (90 days max recommended)
- ✅ Regenerate regularly
- ✅ Pre-authorize to avoid manual steps

### ACL Configuration

- ✅ Use principle of least privilege
- ✅ Restrict SSH access to required tags only
- ✅ Regular audit of tag assignments
- ✅ Monitor device connections
