## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method: Private Security Advisory

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/askb/tailscale-openstack-bastion-action/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### Alternative: Email

Send vulnerability reports to: **security@linuxfoundation.org**

Include:

-   Description of the vulnerability
-   Steps to reproduce
-   Potential impact
-   Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

-   **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
-   **Status Update:** Within 7 days
-   **Fix Timeline:** Varies by severity

## Severity Levels

### Critical

-   Remote code execution
-   Authentication bypass
-   Privilege escalation
-   **Response:** Immediate (24-48 hours)

### High

-   Information disclosure of sensitive data
-   Denial of service
-   **Response:** Within 7 days

### Medium

-   Minor information disclosure
-   Security misconfiguration
-   **Response:** Within 14 days

### Low

-   Best practice violations
-   **Response:** Next regular release

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use OAuth Ephemeral Keys** (recommended)

    - Automatic key rotation
    - Short-lived credentials
    - No manual key management

2. **Rotate Legacy Auth Keys** (if used)

    - Rotate every 90 days maximum
    - Use GitHub Secrets for storage
    - Never commit keys to repositories

3. **Limit Tailscale Permissions**

    - Use appropriate tags (`tag:bastion`)
    - Configure restrictive ACLs
    - Review access regularly

4. **Secure OpenStack Credentials**

    - Store in GitHub Secrets
    - Use application credentials (not user passwords)
    - Limit credential scope

5. **Monitor Bastion Activity**
    - Review GitHub Actions logs
    - Monitor Tailscale admin console
    - Check OpenStack audit logs

### For Developers

1. **Pin External Actions**

    - Use commit SHA pins, not tags
    - Regularly update pinned versions
    - Review changes before updating

2. **Validate Inputs**

    - Never trust user input
    - Sanitize all inputs
    - Use input validation patterns

3. **Handle Secrets Safely**

    - Never log secrets
    - Use GitHub's secret masking
    - Clear secrets after use

4. **Follow Least Privilege**
    - Request minimum required permissions
    - Scope credentials appropriately
    - Use read-only when possible

## Known Security Considerations

### Tailscale Integration

-   **Risk:** Compromised Tailscale credentials could allow network access
-   **Mitigation:**
    -   Use OAuth ephemeral keys with 1-hour expiry
    -   Tag-based ACL restrictions
    -   Automatic cleanup on bastion teardown

### OpenStack Credentials

-   **Risk:** Leaked OpenStack credentials could allow resource creation
-   **Mitigation:**
    -   Store in GitHub Secrets only
    -   Use application credentials with limited scope
    -   Monitor OpenStack activity

### SSH Access

-   **Risk:** Bastion could be used as attack vector
-   **Mitigation:**
    -   Ephemeral bastions (destroyed after use)
    -   Tailscale network isolation
    -   No public IP exposure

### Cloud-Init Scripts

-   **Risk:** Malicious cloud-init could compromise bastion
-   **Mitigation:**
    -   Template-based cloud-init generation
    -   Input validation and sanitization
    -   No dynamic code execution

## Security Updates

Security updates are released:

-   **Critical:** Immediately upon fix
-   **High:** Within 7 days
-   **Medium/Low:** Next regular release

Updates are announced via:

-   GitHub Security Advisories
-   Release notes
-   README.md

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Private Disclosure:** Reported vulnerabilities are kept confidential
2. **Coordinated Fix:** Work with reporter to develop fix
3. **Public Disclosure:** After fix is released (or 90 days, whichever comes first)
4. **Credit:** Reporter credited in security advisory (if desired)

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

-   ✅ OAuth credential management
